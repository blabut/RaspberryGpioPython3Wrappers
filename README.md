# Raspberry-GPIO-python3-wrappers

This repository holds several Python3 wrappers for hardware components interfaceable with a Raspberry Pi.

Each folder is related to a different hardware component and has an example usage file in addition to the source code. Unless a requirements.txt file is present in a component's folder, no dependecy is needed.

These wrappers have been tested with a Raspberry Pi 3b+ and Python 3.5

Please feel free to open a PR or Issue if needed, or get in touch if you want to contribute.
